<h1>Vulnerability Assessmnet Report</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
See Attached PDF File. In this assessment I began by evaluating the risks that were most representative of the organization’s
internal and public operations and then considered a malicious risk as well. I compared
the likelihood of a security incident happening (under open access permissions) with the
incident’s severity and evaluated the total criticality of each risk.
